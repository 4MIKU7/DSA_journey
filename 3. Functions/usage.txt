why to use function ?

-- for easy debugging
-- for easy in reading & understading , maintaining
-- can be use in repeating as many time as you can 

syntax :-
<return_type> <function_name> (parameters)

# func 2 type : user built nd predefined ,
   agai 2 type : void <func> and non-void i.e. int/char/... <func>
   -> "return <value>" is neccesary at the end of non void func
   -> but we can write only return; at the end of void func ; but not any value after return ...
    

***** tips ****
- give the user defined function name in such a say so that 
  any can understand what the function is about

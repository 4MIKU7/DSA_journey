1. pattern problem means = NESTED LOOPS !!! (mostly 2 nests everytime)

2. count the numbers of lines/rows , this will be = no. of OUTER LOOP

3. focus on no. of columns for INNER LOOP & try to connect somehow it to outer loop / rows.

4. whatever u r printing , print them inside the inner loop .

5. observe symmetry [optional step] .
